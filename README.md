# Risk-Assessment-Report
- This assessment identified 8 credible threats across five critical assets. 
- Four threats rate High or Critical and require prompt mitigation most notably endpoint malware propagation (T7) and ransomware‐driven database corruption (T5).
- Recommended actions include endpoint EDR rollout, monthly patch cadence acceleration, WAF deployment, and off site immutable backups.
- Implementing these controls is projected to reduce overall residual risk by 60 % and strengthen ISO 27001 compliance ahead of the upcoming audit.
